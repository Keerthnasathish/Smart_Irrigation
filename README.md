The Smart Irrigation System developed as part of the AICTE Internship Cycle 2 â€“ July 2025 aims to optimize agricultural water usage through a predictive machine learning model. By leveraging real-time environmental data such as soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and rainfall, the system determines the optimal irrigation schedule and water quantity required for crops. This intelligent approach reduces water wastage, enhances crop productivity, and promotes sustainable farming practices. The project utilizes sensors, data analytics, and ML algorithms to monitor field conditions and automate irrigation decisions. Future enhancements include integrating weather APIs, mobile app control, and expansion into fertilizer recommendation and large-scale farm monitoring using satellite or drone data.
