Smart Irrigation System
AICTE Internship Cycle 2 – July 2025

Overview:
This project is part of AICTE Internship Cycle 2 - July 2025 and focuses on building a Smart Irrigation System that optimizes water usage in agriculture through predictive analytics. The objective is to forecast the optimal irrigation schedule using real-time and historical environmental data, helping farmers reduce water wastage and promote sustainable farming.

Key factors used in the prediction model include:

1. Soil moisture levels

2. Temperature and humidity

3. Rainfall and weather conditions

4. Time of day and seasonality

5. Crop water requirements

Project Structure:

Methodology

1. Data Collection: Gathered soil moisture sensor readings, temperature/humidity data, and rainfall information.

2. Preprocessing: Cleaned the raw sensor data, handled missing values, and created time-series features.

3. Model Development:

     Linear Regression

     Decision Tree Regressor

     LSTM for time-dependent irrigation patterns

4. Model Evaluation: Assessed model performance using RMSE, MAE, and R² score.

Use Case:

An example use case includes predicting whether irrigation is needed at a specific field in Tamil Nadu on a hot and dry afternoon based on the soil’s current moisture level, temperature, and expected rainfall.

Technologies Used
1. Python 3.x

2. Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

3. TensorFlow / PyTorch

4. Matplotlib, Seaborn

5. Jupyter Notebooks

6. IoT Sensors (optional)

7. Git, GitHub
